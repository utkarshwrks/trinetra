/**
 * CREDENTIAL HANDLING (DEC-058).
 *
 * bcrypt stays — it is the right primitive and it is already in the tree. Three
 * things change:
 *
 *   1. COST FACTOR 12, up from 10. Roughly 4x the work per guess. A login takes
 *      ~250 ms instead of ~60 ms, which nobody notices and an offline cracker
 *      very much does.
 *   2. A PEPPER from the environment. bcrypt salts per-hash, which defeats
 *      rainbow tables but not an attacker who has the database and can guess
 *      offline. The pepper is not in the database, so a dump alone is not
 *      enough to start guessing.
 *   3. A POLICY ON SET AND RESET ONLY, never on login. Length and a breach-list
 *      check — no composition theatre. "At least one uppercase and one symbol"
 *      pushes people to `Password1!` and buys nothing; length and
 *      not-already-breached are the two rules that actually correlate with
 *      surviving a credential-stuffing attack.
 *
 * Existing hashes keep working. bcrypt encodes its cost in the hash, so a
 * cost-10 hash from before this change verifies exactly as it did, and is
 * upgraded transparently on the owner's next successful login.
