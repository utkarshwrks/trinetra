/**
 * COMMAND PANEL REPORTS (DEC-060).
 *
 * Four new reports, built on the EXISTING `lib/report.ts` path. The three
 * NTRO-mandated formats (`/export/case/{id}.json|.csv|.pdf`) and the one-page
 * vector report in `lib/reportPdf.ts` are untouched and still reachable.
 *
 * Three rules, all inherited rather than reinvented:
 *
 *   1. NO HTML STRING TEMPLATING, however convenient. Every node is built with
 *      `createElement` + `textContent` through `openReport` (INV-6,
 *      FINDING-02). A report is where analyst-authored and market-sourced text
 *      meets a rendering surface, which is exactly where the original bug was.
 *   2. A FIXED LIGHT PALETTE, not the app skin. What the reader sees is what
 *      leaves the building, and a report that arrives in a different colour
 *      scheme each time is a report nobody can cite.
 *   3. EVERY REPORT CARRIES ITS PROVENANCE: the Merkle root, the transaction
 *      hash and chain id WHEN a public anchor exists, engine version, generation
 *      time, and the standing honesty statement. An anchor line appears only
 *      when there is a public anchor -- silence there would let a reader assume
 *      a local seal was a public one.
