/**
 * THE SERVER-SIDE GUARD (DEC-058).
 *
 * Every Command Panel request passes through here. The middleware also guards
 * `/command/*`, and the UI also hides what a role cannot do — but those are a
 * convenience and a routing rule respectively. THIS is the control.
 *
 * The distinction is not pedantry. `middleware.ts` runs on the Edge runtime and
 * cannot read the in-process step-up store; the UI runs in a browser we do not
 * control. If either were the only check, a hand-rolled `fetch` from the
 * console would be enough to purge a retention policy.
 *
 * Order matters and is asserted in `authz.test.ts`:
 *
 *   IP allowlist → session validity → CSRF → role → step-up → rate limit
 *
 * The allowlist is first because a deployment that restricted the panel to an
 * office range means it, and it should not be spending CPU on bcrypt or on
 * ledger writes for traffic it has already decided to refuse.
