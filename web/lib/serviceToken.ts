/**
 * THE SERVICE TOKEN — the engine authorises independently (DEC-060).
 *
 * "The proxy already checked" is not an authorisation model. On a Render
 * deployment the engine has its own public URL, so anything that can reach the
 * network can reach `/admin/*` directly. The engine therefore verifies for
 * itself who is acting and with what role.
 *
 * A short-lived HMAC-signed token rather than a JWT library: the payload is
 * five fields, the algorithm is HMAC-SHA256, and both sides are code we own.
 * Adding a JWT dependency to sign five fields would be more surface, not less.
 *
 * The token is BOUND TO THE REQUEST — path and method are inside the signature.
 * A token minted for `GET /admin/users` cannot be replayed against
 * `POST /admin/retention/purge`, which is the whole point: without binding, a
 * token captured from any admin read would be a general-purpose admin
 * credential for its lifetime.
