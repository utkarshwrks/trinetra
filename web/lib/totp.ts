/**
 * STEP-UP AUTHENTICATION (DEC-059).
 *
 * Every write in the Command Panel requires a fresh TOTP proof. The threat this
 * addresses is specific: a session cookie stolen from an unlocked laptop, or an
 * analyst who walked away. A password protects login; nothing protected the
 * mutations after it.
 *
 * `otplib` (MIT) does the RFC 6238 arithmetic. Everything around it — the
 * replay window, the recovery codes, the server-side token store — is here,
 * because those are the parts that get security wrong.
 *
 * FOUR PROPERTIES, each of which `totp.test.ts` pins:
 *
 *   1. A code is single-use. Accepting the same six digits twice inside its
 *      30-second window means a shoulder-surfed code works for anyone who saw
 *      it, which defeats the point of a second factor.
 *   2. Drift is ±1 window and no more. Wider is friendlier and materially
 *      weaker: every extra window is another 30 seconds of validity for a code
 *      an attacker observed.
 *   3. Recovery codes are hashed at rest and single-use. They are password
 *      equivalents; storing them in the clear would be worse than not having
 *      them.
 *   4. The step-up token lives SERVER-SIDE against the session. A client-held
 *      claim that says "I did TOTP" is a claim the client can forge.
