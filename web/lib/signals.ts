/**
 * SEMANTIC COLOUR — the colours that carry meaning.
 *
 * This is the fix hiding underneath the skin bug (DEC-055).
 *
 * TRINETRA reskins itself, and that is fine for atmosphere: palette, type and
 * shape are decoration. But in this product some colour is not decoration. In
 * the relationship graph colour IS the entity type; on the evidence trail
 * colour IS the signal root. If those move when the skin is redrawn, an analyst
 * comparing two actors sees the colour semantics shift under them mid-
 * investigation. That is not cosmetic -- it is an evidence-integrity problem.
 *
 * So they live here, in one module, as literals:
 *
 *   - defined ONCE, never inside an `html[data-skin]` block,
 *   - mirrored into `:root` in globals.css as `--sig-*` / `--ent-*` tokens for
 *     anything that styles through CSS,
 *   - exported as hex for the DOM and as 0xRRGGBB for three.js, from the same
 *     source, so the 3D graph and its legend cannot drift apart.
 *
 * `__tests__/signals.test.ts` asserts all four of those properties, including
 * that no skin block redefines a semantic token.
 *
 * Chosen for distinguishability under the common colour-vision deficiencies and
 * for legibility on every one of the six skin backgrounds, which are all dark.
 * Shape and label always carry the same information as colour (INV-11), so a
 * colour-blind or monochrome reader loses nothing.
