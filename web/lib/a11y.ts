 * behind it and lose track of where they were, and a screen reader was never
 * told a dialog had opened at all.
 *
 * Live regions matter here because attribution results arrive asynchronously:
 * an analyst using a screen reader must be told when a verification comes back
 * red, not discover it by tabbing into the panel.
