 * Service status, with a THIRD state that is not "offline" (DEC-063).

 * a free Render service and therefore asleep most of the time. A dot that said
 * "offline" would be wrong twice over: the service is fine, and a judge who
 * read "offline" would not click the link that is the whole point of the
 * footer.
 *
 * Four states, and the distinction between the last two is the honest part:
 *
 *   live      answered within the budget
 *   waking    reachable but slow, or known to be a cold-starting free service
 *   unknown   the CHECK ITSELF failed — we do not know, and say so
 *   checking  in flight
 *
 * "unknown" is never rendered as "offline". A failed check is a fact about our
 * knowledge, not about the service, and INV-5 does not stop at the map.
