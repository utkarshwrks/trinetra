          THE ONLY dangerouslySetInnerHTML in the tree, and the only inline
          script. It is safe because SKIN_PICKER_SCRIPT is a module constant
          built from a hardcoded skin registry: no user input, no request data
          and no engine response reaches it. It must be inline and synchronous
          — an external script would paint the default palette first and then
          repaint, which is the flash this exists to prevent.

          The INV-6 lint rule fires here by design. Disabling it at this single
          site keeps the exception greppable; a blanket allowance would let the
          next one in silently, which is how FINDING-02 happened.

          vertical space from the evidence to display a copyright notice.
