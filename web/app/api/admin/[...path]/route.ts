/**
 * THE ADMIN TRUST BOUNDARY (DEC-058, DEC-060).
 *
 * A SECOND proxy, deliberately separate from `/api/engine/[...path]`.
 *
 * The existing engine proxy is an allowlist for read paths a signed-in analyst
 * may reach. Admin paths are a different class of thing: they mutate evidence,
 * and they need a role check, a CSRF check, a step-up check, a rate limit and a
 * ledger entry. Bolting all of that onto the existing route would mean one
 * function whose behaviour depends on which arm of a branch it took — and the
 * failure mode of getting that branch wrong is an unauthenticated purge.
 *
 * Two routes, two allowlists, one shared decision table. `/admin` is NOT added
 * to the read proxy's ALLOWED array, and `security.test.ts` asserts it never is.
 *
 * The engine authorises INDEPENDENTLY. This proxy sends a signed service token
 * carrying the acting user and role, and the engine verifies it itself — it does
 * not assume this proxy is the only caller, because on a Render deployment the
 * engine has its own public URL.
