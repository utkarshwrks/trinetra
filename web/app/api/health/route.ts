/**
 * The web service's keep-alive endpoint (DEC-064).
 *
 * STATIC BY DEFAULT. No session lookup, no engine call, no database. Its only
 * job is to be an inbound request that resets Render's 15-minute idle timer,
 * and that requires nothing but answering — a keep-alive that does work is a
 * keep-alive that consumes the thing it is protecting.
 *
 * `?deep=1` optionally proxies the engine's own ping through the existing
 * allowlisted proxy, for a single call that wakes both services. It is opt-in
 * precisely because the default must stay cheap: a scheduled deep ping every
 * ten minutes would wake the engine even on days nobody uses it.
