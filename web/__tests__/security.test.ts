/**
 * The invariants, asserted against the source tree itself.
 *
 * These are static assertions, not behavioural ones, because the properties are
 * structural: "no file does X" cannot be proven by exercising one code path.
 * They are the cheapest possible check and they guard the three things this
 * product cannot afford to get wrong -- INV-2 (the trust boundary), INV-6
 * (escape by construction), INV-7 (no decorative glyphs).
 *
 * They have not run since `aa8789e`.
 *
 * The linter enforces INV-6 too (.eslintrc.js). Two layers on purpose: the
 * linter sees every compiled file but is configurable away per-line, while this
 * walks the tree and counts the exceptions. FINDING-02 was a forgotten call
 * site; a single layer is how it stayed forgotten.
