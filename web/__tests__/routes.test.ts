/**

 * Structural assertions over `app/`, because the thing most likely to go wrong
 * in a ten-route refactor is not a component -- it is a route that quietly
 * stops existing, or a legacy surface that quietly stops being reachable. The
 * prime directive of this upgrade is "additive only, nothing that works today
 * may stop working", and that is a claim about the file tree as much as about
 * behaviour.
 *
 * Rendering behaviour is covered by the e2e walk, which loads all eleven routes
 * in a real browser against a real engine.
