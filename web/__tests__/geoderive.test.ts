/**
 * SETU coordinates (`lib/geoderive.ts`).
 *
 * INV-5, at its sharpest. Where a host does not resolve, this module DERIVES a
 * coordinate from the identifier so the map is deterministic and legible. That
 * is defensible only while two things hold: the derivation is stable, and every
 * derived point is labelled `inferred: true` so it can never be read as a
 * measurement.
 *
 * Phase 5 added the engine-side three-class model (RESOLVED / DERIVED /
 * UNAVAILABLE) in `engine/geo/classify.py`, with its own marker shapes and its
 * own tests. This module keeps its `inferred` flag because the map still reads
 * it and the prime directive says not to break a working caller -- so these
 * tests pin the honesty and determinism properties on THIS side of the line.
 *
 * FINDING-06 was found here in Phase 0b and fixed here in DEC-061.
