   * HYDRATION GATE.
   *
   * This form submits through `onSubmit`, which does not exist until React has
   * hydrated. Before that the button is still a real submit button inside a
   * real <form>, so a click does a NATIVE GET submission back to /login -- the
   * page reloads, no error is shown, and the user is left staring at the login
   * screen wondering what they did wrong. The credentials are not leaked (the
   * inputs carry no `name`, so nothing is serialised into the query string),
   * but the failure is completely silent, which is worse than a loud one.
   *
   * It is not theoretical: the acceptance journey hit it every run against the
   * deployed free-tier instance, where the JS bundle takes long enough to
   * arrive that a fast click lands first. A judge typing their password and
   * hitting Enter is exactly that fast click.
   *
   * `useEffect` runs only on the client after hydration, so this flips true at
   * precisely the moment the handler becomes real.

        This line used to read "Disabled entirely in production" unconditionally,
        which was false on the deployment it was most likely to be read on: the
        public demo runs with ENABLE_DEMO_ACCOUNT=1, so the account whose
        password is printed above it is very much live. A system whose pitch is
        a published error rate and a record nobody can quietly edit cannot
        afford a login screen that misstates its own security posture.
