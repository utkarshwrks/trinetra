/**
 * The SETU Pro map (DEC-061).
 *
 * MARKER SHAPE CARRIES THE CLASS:
 *
 *   RESOLVED  a solid filled pin
 *   DERIVED   a hollow pin with a DASHED ring, and no pulse
 *
 * Shape, not colour. Colour is skin-dependent (DEC-055) and fails for
 * colour-blind readers, so a viewer must be able to tell a measured point from
 * a region in greyscale.
 *
 * TWO RULES the drawing obeys:
 *
 *   * A DERIVED point never gets an accuracy circle. A circle implies a radius
 *     of confidence in metres; a region has no such thing, and drawing one
 *     would be inventing precision.
 *   * Co-located points are CLUSTERED with a count badge, never scattered.
 *     Jitter on a real coordinate is fabrication, so identical coordinates stay
 *     identical and the map shows how many share them.
