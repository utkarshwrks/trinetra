# TRINETRA — Deployment Guide

Everything needed to put TRINETRA online for **free**: the Next.js frontend on
**Vercel**, the FastAPI engine on **Render**, and the on-chain anchor contract on
**Polygon Amoy** (a zero-cost testnet). Three of these steps need *your* accounts
and a faucet click — those are marked **[you]**. Everything else is already wired.

> ### Deploys from `main`
> Everything here deploys **TRINETRA v2 from the `main` branch** of
> `github.com/utkarshwrks/trinetra`.
> - **Render:** `render.yaml` is pinned to `branch: main` and defines
>   `trinetra-v2-engine` + `trinetra-v2-web`, so one Blueprint deploy builds both.
> - **Vercel (optional):** set the project's **Production Branch** to `main`.

## 0. What is already prepared (in this repo)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `engine/Dockerfile` | Builds the FastAPI engine (Python 3.12) with **Tor** for the live timing demo. |
| `render.yaml` | Render blueprint — free Docker web service, `/health` check. |
| `web/vercel.json` | Next.js build config for Vercel. |
| `.dockerignore` | Keeps `.venv`, `node_modules`, `.next`, `.secrets` out of the image. |
| `web/.env.production.example` | The env vars Vercel needs. |
| `engine/.env.production.example` | The env vars Render needs. |
| `scripts/deploy_amoy.sh` | One-shot contract deploy + anchor + explorer links. |

---

## 1. Push the code to GitHub  **[you may need to authorize]**

The remote is already `github.com/utkarshwrks/trinetra`. From the repo root:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "deploy: configs + docs"
git push origin main
```

Both Vercel and Render deploy from the **`main`** branch.

---

## 2. Backend → Render (free)  **[you]**

The engine is a Docker web service. Render's free plan sleeps after ~15 min idle
and cold-starts in ~30–60 s — perfectly fine for a demo.

1. Go to **render.com → New → Blueprint**, pick the `trinetra` repo. Render reads
   `render.yaml` and proposes the `trinetra-v2-engine` and `trinetra-v2-web` services. Click **Apply**.
   *(Or: New → Web Service → Docker → set Dockerfile path `engine/Dockerfile`,
   context `.`, plan Free, health check `/health`.)*
2. First build takes ~5–10 min (it installs scipy/sklearn/spacy/Tor). When it is
   live you get a URL like `https://trinetra-v2-engine.onrender.com`.
3. Test it: open `https://trinetra-v2-engine.onrender.com/health` → `{"ok": true …}`.

**Env vars** (already defaulted in `render.yaml`, override in the dashboard if
needed): `ENVIRONMENT=production`, `RPC_URL`, `CHAIN_ID=80002`, `CORS_ORIGINS=*`.
Add `ANCHORER_KEY=0x…` **only** if you want the deployed engine to seal on-chain
(see §4); never commit that key.

> Free-tier note: the engine imports scipy/sklearn/spacy, which is heavy for a
> 512 MB instance. It boots fine; if a specific ML endpoint OOMs under load, bump
> to Render's cheapest paid instance or disable that endpoint. The core workbench,
> fusion, ledger and Tor demo run within free limits.

---

## 3. Frontend → Vercel (free)  **[you]**

1. Go to **vercel.com → Add New → Project**, import the `Trinetra` repo.
2. **Set Root Directory to `web`** (it is a monorepo). Framework auto-detects as
   Next.js.
3. Add **Environment Variables** (Settings → Environment Variables):
   - `ENGINE_URL` = your Render URL, e.g. `https://trinetra-v2-engine.onrender.com`
     *(server-side only — the browser never sees it)*
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` = a strong random string → `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` = your Vercel URL, e.g. `https://trinetra.vercel.app`
4. **Deploy.** Done — open the Vercel URL, click **Open workbench**, sign in with
   the pre-filled demo analyst account.

> The app refuses to start in production without `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` — that is by
> design. Set it before the first deploy.

---

## 4. On-chain anchor contract → Polygon Amoy  **[you fund, then one command]**

The whole system is **zero-gas for users**: one backend wallet anchors every case
Merkle root, funded once from a free faucet. That wallet is already generated:

```
Anchorer address:  0x31EdD0021A09f0B32f7dfeb08B58622c75591991
Status:            NOT FUNDED yet (balance 0)
```

### 4a. Get free testnet POL  **[you — needs a captcha/wallet, I can't do this step]**

Claim **Amoy POL** to the address above from any of these (use one or two):

- **https://faucet.polygon.technology** → select **Amoy**, token **POL**, paste
  the address, submit.
- **https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy** (needs a free Alchemy login).
- **https://faucets.chain.link/polygon-amoy**

One claim (~0.5–1 POL) is *far* more than enough (see the budget below).

### 4b. Deploy + anchor (one command)

Foundry is installed. Once the address shows a balance:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_amoy.sh
```

It deploys `TrinetraAnchor`, anchors a real case root, and prints:

```
CONTRACT : https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x…
ANCHOR TX: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/tx/0x…
```

### 4c. Point the engine at the contract

Set on Render (or in `engine/.env`): `CONTRACT_ADDR=<deployed address>`,
`RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology`, `CHAIN_ID=80002`, and
`ANCHORER_KEY=<the funded key>`. Now the Ledger panel’s **Seal** button writes a
real, publicly verifiable anchor and shows the explorer link.

---

## 5. Budget — demoing 100+ times

Amoy is a **testnet**: POL there has no monetary value and is free to top up.

| Action | Gas (approx) | Cost @ ~30 gwei |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Deploy `TrinetraAnchor` (once) | ~600k | ~0.02 POL |
| One anchor/seal (per demo) | ~55k | ~0.0017 POL |
| **100 seals** | ~5.5M | **~0.17 POL** |

So **one faucet claim covers the deploy plus 100+ full demos** with room to spare.
If you ever run low, claim again — it is free. And note: the **workbench demo
itself runs unlimited times for free** — only the *public on-chain seal* spends
test-POL; everything else (attribution, evidence trail, Tor timing, chain flow,
the local tamper-evident ledger) is entirely gas-free.

---

## 6. One-look summary

```
[you] fund 0x31EdD0…1991 with Amoy POL   →   ./scripts/deploy_amoy.sh
[you] Render  ← engine/Dockerfile + render.yaml   →   ENGINE_URL
[you] Vercel  ← root dir "web" + ENGINE_URL/NEXTAUTH_SECRET/NEXTAUTH_URL
        live at https://<your-app>.vercel.app
```

Nothing here costs money. The only human-gated steps are creating the Vercel/
Render accounts and the faucet click — an assistant cannot create accounts, grant
OAuth, or solve a faucet captcha on your behalf, so those three clicks are yours;
every file, command and env var they need is above.

---

## Command Panel (v2.1 Phase 4)

The management surface is **off by default** and needs three secrets before it
will serve anything. Without them it refuses with a 503 that names the missing
variable — it does not silently fall back.

| Variable | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | web | Session signing (DEC-045). Production refuses the committed dev default separately. |
| `PASSWORD_PEPPER` | web | Peppers bcrypt, so a database dump alone is not enough to start guessing (DEC-058). |
| `ENGINE_SERVICE_SECRET` | **web AND engine** | The engine verifies admin calls independently (DEC-060). The two values MUST match, or every admin call answers 401. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_COMMAND=1` | web | Turns the panel on. Build-time. |
| `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` | web, optional | Comma-separated CIDRs. Unset allows everything; set-but-unidentifiable **refuses**. |
| `DEMO_ROLE` | web, optional | Role for the seeded demo account. Defaults to `officer`, and is bounded by `ENABLE_DEMO_ACCOUNT`, which is off in production. |

Generate each with `openssl rand -base64 32`.

### Before turning it on

1. Set all three secrets. `ENGINE_SERVICE_SECRET` on **both** services.
2. Every user who will make a change must enrol an authenticator — the panel
   offers enrolment on first use and shows eight recovery codes **once**.
3. `web/data/totp.json` holds the enrolments. It is gitignored and written 0600.
   Back it up like a credential store; losing it means every user re-enrols.
4. Behind a proxy, ensure it **overwrites** `x-forwarded-for`. The IP allowlist
   reads that header and it is spoofable by anything that can reach the app
   directly. It is defence in depth, never the only gate.

### The single-node limitation, stated

The step-up store, the session registry and the rate limiter are all in-process
(DEC-046). Behind several instances:

- a step-up proved on one node is unknown to the others, so the analyst is asked
  for a second code — annoying, and it fails **closed**;
- each process keeps its own rate-limit window, so the effective limit multiplies
  by instance count;
- a restart logs everyone out, because an unknown session id is treated as
  revoked.

Correct for a single-node district deployment. A scaled one needs a shared
store, and the playbook forbids Redis — so that is a deliberate open item, not
an oversight.
