"""The keep-alive RUNNER (DEC-075).

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY THE CRON DID NOT WORK.

The first design was a `*/5` cron that woke, pinged once and exited. It was
correct arithmetic on a trigger that does not fire. Measured on this repo over
2026-09-03..04: the schedule asked for ~120 runs a day and GitHub delivered
FOUR IN TWO DAYS -- 07:39, 12:15 and 16:29 on the 3rd, 07:37 on the 4th. That
is not a bug in the workflow; GitHub documents `schedule` as best-effort and
drops high-frequency crons under load, and a run every four to nine hours is
useless against Render's fifteen-minute idle timer. The service was asleep for
essentially the whole "warm window", which is exactly what a user sees as the
project being down.

So the fix is to stop needing a frequent trigger. ONE run holds the runner for
a long SEGMENT, ticking every few minutes from inside a single job, and then
dispatches its own successor. A chain needs the scheduler to work once, not a
hundred and twenty times a day -- and `workflow_dispatch` fired with
GITHUB_TOKEN is one of the two events GitHub explicitly permits to start a new
run, so the chain is self-sustaining.

This is affordable only because the repo is PUBLIC: standard runners are free
and unmetered there, so the runner's wall-clock costs nothing. The scarce
resource is unchanged -- Render's 750 free instance hours per workspace per
month -- and every tick still asks the budget guard for permission.

The runner is not the authority on the budget. `keepalive_budget.py` is, and it
fails closed; this module imports it rather than re-deriving the arithmetic,
because two implementations of one budget is how a budget gets exceeded.
