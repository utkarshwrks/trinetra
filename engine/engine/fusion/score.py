"""Evidence fusion. The number the whole project is judged on.

Naive evidence stacking assumes every signal is independent. It is not, and the
consequence is not academic: five correlated signals stack to 0.999, which is a
claim of near-certainty that will not survive cross-examination.

TRINETRA does three things instead:

  1. LIKELIHOOD RATIOS.  LR = s / (1 - s). A probability is not evidence
     strength; the ratio is.

  2. ROOT-CAUSE COLLAPSE.  Signals are grouped by WHY they agree, and only the
     strongest survives per root. Two views of one certificate are one fact.
     This is the step that stops double-counting.

  3. RELIABILITY DAMPENING.  LR_root ^ r, where r reflects how much that class
     of evidence has earned. A PGP key (0.9) is not a writing style (0.5).

        LR_total   = PROD over roots of  LR_root ^ r_root
        posterior  = prior_odds x LR_total
        p          = odds / (1 + odds)

Prior odds are 1:10 for a pair that survived blocking, 1:10,000 otherwise --
being proposed as a candidate is itself weak evidence, and pretending otherwise
would smuggle in the base rate.

Every number in `trail` must recompute `p_raw` exactly. A score whose trail does
not reproduce it is a Critical finding (D3.2 objective 3).
