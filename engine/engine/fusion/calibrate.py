"""Calibration and the conformal false-merge guarantee.

Two different claims, and the difference matters:

  CALIBRATION says "when we output 0.84, it is right about 84% of the time."
  Measured by Brier score and Expected Calibration Error. Isotonic regression
  fits the mapping from raw score to observed frequency.

  CONFORMAL PREDICTION says "among links we accept at threshold tau, at most
  alpha are wrong." That is a distribution-free finite-sample guarantee, not a
  hope. It makes no assumption about the score being well-behaved -- only that
  the validation split is exchangeable with what comes next.

The second is the defensible one, and it is why TRINETRA can publish a
false-merge rate at all. A team that shows a graph and a confidence number
cannot say what happens when they are wrong. This can.

Split-conformal, concretely: sort the calibration scores of the KNOWN NEGATIVE
pairs, and pick tau at the (1-alpha) quantile. By construction, at most an
alpha fraction of negatives sit above it, so the false-merge rate among
accepted links is bounded by alpha with finite-sample coverage.
