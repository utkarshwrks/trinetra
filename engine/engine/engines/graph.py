"""Neo4j identity graph - nodes, typed weighted edges, and GDS actor resolution.

Edge weights are the playbook's, and they are not arbitrary: they encode how
much each relationship is worth as evidence of shared control. Only the two
HARD identifiers (a signing key and a paid-to wallet) are allowed to form an
actor, because those are the only edges a person cannot casually share.

    SIGNED_WITH  0.95   same PGP key                 HARD
    PAID_TO      0.80   same wallet address          HARD
    CONTACT      0.70   same email / telegram        soft
    VOUCHES_FOR  0.30   trust / rating link          soft
    MENTIONS     0.20   co-mentioned entity          soft
    LOCATED      ----   persona -> city              soft

Everything is MERGE, so loading twice yields the same graph. Idempotence is
tested, not assumed: the Phase 4 reload job runs on a schedule.

The engine degrades honestly when Neo4j is down -- it reports unavailable
rather than raising, exactly like every other capability.
