"""Authorship features and similarity.

Stylometry is the WEAKEST evidence TRINETRA uses, and it is treated that way:
its reliability exponent in fusion is 0.5, half that of a PGP key. Writing
style is imitable, and the testbed's decoy exists to prove we know that.

Features, all computed on CPU with no model download required:
  - TF-IDF over character 3-5 grams (habits below the level of word choice)
  - function-word frequencies (the classic authorship signal - content words
    change with the product, function words do not)
  - type-token ratio, mean word length
  - punctuation and formatting habits (ellipsis style, double spaces, caps)
  - Hinglish markers: romanised-Hindi token ratio, Devanagari presence,
    -ji / bhai / bhaiya usage

LaBSE sentence embeddings are additive when available and absent otherwise;
the engine badge reports which path actually ran.
