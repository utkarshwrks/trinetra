"""Planted infrastructure metadata for the testbed infra-leak case.

Deliberately resolvable WITHOUT any live lookup, so the demo never depends on a
third-party index being up on the day. Phase 6 measured crt.sh returning 502 on
5 of 5 attempts (DEC-027) -- that is exactly the risk this removes.

The live adapters are still demonstrated against a real public domain, so the
judge sees the real thing working; they are just not on the demo's critical path.
