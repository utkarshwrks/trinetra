"""THE THREE COORDINATE CLASSES (DEC-061).

Every point on the SETU map is exactly one of:

    RESOLVED     host -> DNS A/AAAA -> geo-IP returned a real location.
    DERIVED      no resolution; a stable coordinate standing for a known
                 hosting or exchange region. NOT a measured location.
    UNAVAILABLE  nothing to place. Never plotted; listed with the reason.

The distinction is the whole point of the map. A derived point drawn like a
measured one is a picture of an assumption presented as evidence, and an
analyst who cannot tell them apart cannot use either.

HARD RULES, each with a test:

  * A DERIVED coordinate is rounded to ONE DECIMAL PLACE (~11 km). Carrying
    six decimals would imply metre precision the rule does not have.
  * NO RANDOM JITTER, ever. Two hosts that genuinely share a location get two
    identical coordinates and are clustered by the UI. Scattering them to look
    prettier is fabrication.
  * A DERIVED coordinate is DETERMINISTIC: the same host yields the same point
    across runs and across processes, so two analysts comparing screenshots see
    the same map.
  * `.onion` is NEVER resolved (INV-1). It is UNAVAILABLE by construction, and
    the reason says so as a feature.
