"""INDEPENDENT AUTHORISATION FOR THE ADMIN SCOPE (DEC-060).

"The web proxy already checked" is not an authorisation model. On a Render
deployment this service has its own public URL, so anything that can reach the
network can reach ``/admin/*`` directly. Every admin request is therefore
verified here, against the same role table the web layer uses, with no
assumption that the proxy is the only caller.

The token is an HMAC-SHA256 over a compact payload, minted by
``web/lib/serviceToken.ts``. Both halves are code we own, and
``test_admin_auth.py`` pins the wire format so the two cannot drift.

It is BOUND TO THE REQUEST: path and method are inside the signature, so a
token minted for ``GET /admin/users`` cannot be replayed against
``POST /admin/retention/purge``. Without that binding, a token captured from
any admin read would be a general-purpose admin credential for its lifetime.
