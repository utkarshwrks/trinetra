    The complaint this endpoint exists for is real and specific: on a free
    Render instance the deployed app feels slow while a local one is instant.
    There are exactly three causes, and they are different problems with
    different fixes, so this reports which one is actually in play:

      1. COLD START. The instance was spun down and is booting. ~60 s, and
         nothing can be done about it except not being spun down -- which is
         what the keep-alive window is for.
      2. COLD CACHES. The process is up but `build_signals()` and the
         calibrator have not finished. The first fusion or audit call then
         takes ~20 s (DEC-054), which the proxy's 45 s ceiling survives but a
         judge's patience does not.
      3. A DEPENDENCY IS DOWN. Postgres or Neo4j unreachable. The engine still
         answers (INV-9) but specific panels degrade.

    Read-only and cheap: it inspects module state and touches no external
    service. It is NOT the keep-alive endpoint -- that one touches nothing at
    all -- and it is safe to call from a status page.
