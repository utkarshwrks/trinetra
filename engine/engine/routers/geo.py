"""Real host -> region geolocation for the SETU map.

A clearnet host resolves to an IP; the IP resolves to a physical region via a
key-free geo-IP service. This is genuine geolocation of real infrastructure —
the same public-data ethos as the rest of TRINETRA. Results are cached, and the
endpoint NEVER raises: an unresolvable host (e.g. a synthetic demo host that is
not in DNS) returns resolved=false so the UI can fall back and say so.

EXTENDED IN PHASE 5 (DEC-061, DEC-062), not rewritten. `/geo/host` and
`/geo/hosts` keep their shape and their 32-host cap; every field they returned
before is still returned. What is new is additive: a `class`, a timestamped
`resolution_chain`, ASN, reverse DNS, cache age, and four further endpoints.

FINDING-09 is fixed here. `_resolve` called `socket.gethostbyname()` on any
host it was given, INCLUDING a `.onion` — the query failed, but it was issued,
and INV-1 is about what the process DOES, not about what it returns. A spy test
now proves no lookup happens.
