"""A live Tor timing-correlation experiment on infrastructure we control.

Everything here is our own: a throwaway HTTP backend, an ephemeral hidden
service pointing at it, and a client that fetches it through Tor. Because both
endpoints are ours, observing the timing at each and correlating them is legal
and reproducible — and it is a genuine network-layer result, not a mock.

The flow:

  1. start a local HTTP backend that timestamps every request it receives
     (this is the "service" observation point)
  2. launch a tor process via stem with an EPHEMERAL hidden service mapping
     onion:80 -> that backend
  3. drive a client that fetches the .onion through tor's SOCKS proxy, on a
     deliberate timing pattern, timestamping each send (the "client" point)
  4. correlate the two timestamp streams (timing.py)

If tor cannot bootstrap (no network, or tor absent), the experiment falls back
to a CONTROLLED REPLAY over the same real correlation engine, clearly badged as
`simulated` so a viewer is never misled about what ran. The maths is identical;
only the transport differs.
