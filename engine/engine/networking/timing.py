"""Traffic-timing correlation — the maths behind an onion de-anonymisation.

This is the technique that actually unmasks hidden services in the real world,
stated honestly: Tor hides *which* IP you are, not *when* you send. An adversary
who can observe traffic timing at the entry (near the client) and at the exit
(near the service) can line up the two streams and show they are the same
conversation — WITHOUT decrypting anything.

TRINETRA demonstrates this on infrastructure it fully controls (its own hidden
service and its own client), so the demo is legal, reproducible, and a genuine
network-layer result rather than a mock. In production the same maths runs where
the operator already controls a relay or has a lawful vantage point.

The engine here is source-independent: it takes two timestamp streams and
reports how strongly they correlate. `tor_testbed.py` produces real streams from
a live local Tor circuit; the maths does not care where they came from.
