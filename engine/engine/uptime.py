"""Keep-alive budget accounting (DEC-064, DEC-065).

VERIFIED FIGURES, from Render's live documentation on 2026-09-03:

    * 750 free instance hours per WORKSPACE per calendar month -- shared
      across every free service, not granted per service.
    * A free web service spins down after 15 minutes without inbound traffic.
    * Spin-up takes about one minute.
    * Hours are consumed only while a service is RUNNING. A spun-down service
      consumes none.

The arithmetic those figures force, for three free services (engine, web, and
the already-deployed v1):

    750 h / 2 kept-warm services    = 375 h per service per month
    375 h / 30.44 days              = 12.3 h per service per day
    with the 85% guard              = 10.47 h per service per day
    with an 85% guard: 637.5 / 3 / 30.44 = 6.98 h per service per day

So the schedule is a ~7-hour daily warm window, NOT the "12 hours each" the
playbook assumed -- that assumption was written for two services, and there are
three. The playbook's own instruction was that the schedule adapts to the real
numbers, so it does.

This module tracks what has actually been spent. It FAILS CLOSED: if the budget
cannot be computed, pinging stops rather than continuing blind.
